# Mobile App Testing
- Tools
	- [Mobexler](https://mobexler.com/) - haven't used it yet - let me know if it's any good
	- [APKLab](https://github.com/APKLab/APKLab) - Extension for Visual Studio Code which decompiles, recompiles and signs apks. Edit the smali in VS Code and then recompile for the win.
- Practice Apps
	- [OWASP Crackme Apps](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-mstg/tree/master/Crackmes) - Most recent apps I have found to practice on. Most of the others are too old to compile in Android Studio 4
