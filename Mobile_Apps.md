# Mobile App Testing
- Tools
	- [Mobexler](https://mobexler.com/) - A pre-configured virtual machine "designed to help in penetration testing of Android & iOS applications". I haven't used it yet - let me know if it's any good
	- [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) - The primary tool for developing Android apps. Comes with a virtual machine manager (Android Virtual Device Manager) and allows easy install of required SDKs. Also comes with adb, the Android Debug Bridge, allowing communication via USB or TCP to an Android device. The SDKs and adb can be installed separately but installing Android Studio eases the pain a little. 
	- [APKLab](https://github.com/APKLab/APKLab) - Extension for Visual Studio Code which decompiles, recompiles and signs apks. Edit the smali in VS Code and then recompile for the win. Has a certificate pinning bypass; however, this no longer seems to work
	- [Frida](https://frida.re/) - "Dynamic instrumentation toolkit for developers, reverse-engineers, and security researchers". Allows for modification of an application on many OSs (Win, MacOS, Linux, iOS, Android...) at execution time. Inject into the process and override functions with JavaScript code. Has a Python API to control the JS, or a CLI.
	- [Genymotion](https://www.genymotion.com/) - Commercial alternative to Android Virtual Device Manager. Genymotion is a paid service for cloud based or local mobile virtualisation. I haven't used it, however it is apparently much faster than AVD based VMs and has a much wider range of available device images. Requires VirtualBox for local use
	- [objection](https://github.com/sensepost/objection) - "a runtime mobile exploration toolkit, powered by Frida, built to help you assess the security posture of your mobile applications, without needing a jailbreak". I have only scratched the surface of this one, but it appears very powerful. A core use for objection for penetration testing is to patch an APK to embed the frida-gadget to use frida without root
	- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - Microsoft's open source cross platform IDE. Comes with a bunch of extensions for use with most mobile related languages and has the above mentioned APKLab extension (not from MS) which automates a lot of the tedious parts of dealing with apks. Has a [browser based version](https://vscode.dev/), but you can't run a lot of the required extensions in that one
	- [radare2](https://github.com/radareorg/radare2) - a popular command line reverse engineering program/framework. It has many plugins, including one to bridge it to Frida and another to use the decompiler from Ghidra
	- [Ghidra](https://ghidra-sre.org/) - Open Source version of the NSA developed reverse engineering tool. Includes disassembler and C decompiler for many architectures 
- Practice Apps
	- [OWASP Crackme Apps](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-mstg/tree/master/Crackmes) - Most recent apps I have found to practice on. Most of the others are too old to compile in Android Studio 4

- Tutorials
	- [11x256's Reverse Engineering blog](https://11x256.github.io/Frida-hooking-android-part-1/) - A little out of date now, but a good basic intro to Frida if you know the core concepts
	- [HackTricks Frida Tutorial](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/mobile-pentesting/android-app-pentesting#frida) - less a tutorial and more a link to other tutorials, and some basic examples without real explanations
	- [HackTricks Smali - Decompiling/[Modifying]/Compiling](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/mobile-apps-pentesting/android-app-pentesting/smali-changes) - Some links and basic examples of editing smali code

- Useful Documentation
	- [Dalvik opcodes](http://pallergabor.uw.hu/androidblog/dalvik_opcodes.html) - List of opcodes for the Dalvik VM. Most useful for the translations to smali with smali examples. Beware Dalvik has been replaced with Android runtime (ART), but the smali examples appear to still be correct/relevant
	- [OWASP Mobile Security Testing Guide](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-mstg) - guide to testing mobile security. Includes lots of detail with potential tests and mitigations
