# General

This section is for various links and tools which cover many different topics across the penetration testing field. If I can't pin down exactly where it should go it will probably go here.

  - [Payload all the things!](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings) The most generally useful site I have found so far
  - [Pen Test Tools - High On Coffee](https://highon.coffee/blog/penetration-testing-tools-cheat-sheet/)
  - [0xMrNiko - Awesome-Red-Teaming](https://github.com/0xMrNiko/Awesome-Red-Teaming) Large list of tools and links
